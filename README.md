# Battleship
Console game created in Python for the course "Introduction to Programming I" at OsloMet.

**Description:**

At the start, the player will be taken to a main menu, where he/she has three initial choices:
1. Modify the size of the map (minimum 3x3 and maximum 10x10).
2. Numbers of ships (small/medium/large) for the player and AI.
3. Start game.

Then, the player can type the number of the area to fire at. The AI will attack a random spot after.

The game ends when either the player or the AI has lost all their ships - meaning that all the positions that the ships take have been hit.
